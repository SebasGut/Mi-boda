It's a page for a couple for their wedding. this page was created in HTML5 and styled whit CSS, using JS to the functionalities like the clock on regressive count and the welcome message that add a blur effect until the user clicks on the button "Aceptar".
In this page I against to a problem whit the audio tag. 
A politics from webs browsers in a mobile device, makes that the attribute "autoplay” doesn’t go in an expected way because this policy does not accept de autoplay multimedia until the user makes a interaction to the page first.
The solution that I used, was render a div whit a welcome message and one button. Ussing JS, I aim to the button whit a "getElementById” for when the user clicks that button the script for the audio tag runs.
Thats makes that the user should had an interaction before seeing the complete page also that trigger the music in mobile devices. The page in web browser doesn’t be affected whit that fix.
